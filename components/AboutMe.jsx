I am a full stack engineer with a passion for designing 
for people. With 2 years of 
experience in the realm of software and analytics, 
I have a strong foundation in project management, working 
in fast-paced cross functional teams across continents and
 timezones, and leveraging technology in a collaborative 
 environment to build custom solutions to solve business p
 roblems. I am excited about building scalable, modern, 
 robust, and cost-effective solutions, while always
  focusing first on the end user.
